# How to get an API key

To use the Sanction List API from cubemos, you need an API Key to be included in all REST API calls. Without the key, the API request will fail with the error code 401. 

1. To get your own API Key please contact meet@cubemos.com
2. For testing purposes, please use the key “sanction_api_cubemos” in the header of the API call. 

<!-- theme: info -->
> ``` x-api-key: sanction_api_cubemos ```
